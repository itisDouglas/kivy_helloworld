# Basic Kivy Helloworld Application

This application is a basic Kivy application that'll show text input for Username and Password. The prompt was developed as a practice run with Kivy.

In order to use this, I used gitbash. You can download Gitbash here [Gitbash](https://git-scm.com/downloads). 

# Kivy

Install Kivy using the instructions found on their [website](https://kivy.org/doc/stable/installation/installation-windows.html#start-a-kivy-application).

# helloworld.py

Once you've installed Gitbash, download the helloworld.py file. Go to that folder, and run Gitbash in that directory. Run the file using the following command:

    python helloworld.py

What will appear on screen is a prompt to enter username and password. This is just a mock up to continue delving into Kivy. # kivy_helloworld
